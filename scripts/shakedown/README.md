# shakedown

A known-answer acceptance suite for verdi-bench: positive controls the
instrument must **recover** and adversarial negatives every fence must
**refuse**. The hermetic scripts author + drive experiments in-process through
`harness.sdk` (builders + `ExperimentWorkspace`), asserting each guarantee
fires; the pre-registration refusals still exercise the installed `bench plan`
console script (their point is the CLI's refusal→exit-code mapping). See
[`docs/design/shakedown.md`](../../docs/design/shakedown.md) for the full
design, the capability→vector map, and the honest caveats.

## Hermetic gate (no keys, no Docker)

```bash
make shakedown            # golden.py + tripwires.py
```

- **`golden.py`** — L1: the full pipeline (plan→run→grade→judge→review→process→
  analyze→forensics→verify-chain) on the fake engine + fake judge; asserts the
  known positive control (Δ +0.5, decision MET).
- **`tripwires.py`** — L3: 18 adversarial vectors (pre-registration refusals,
  ledger tamper, analyze fence, cost/insulation/stats, gaming, asymmetric
  contamination); asserts every fence fires with its exact reason.

## Opt-in full-fidelity layers

```bash
# P3 (local half) — keyless end-to-end pipeline smoke over corpus groundwork-v0
# on the FAKE engine, grading through the REAL flowmap/groundwork gate (local-exec
# ADVISORY tier). No keys, no Docker, but it builds the verdi-go binaries from
# /home/user/verdi-go if VERDI_FLOWMAP_BIN/VERDI_GROUNDWORK_BIN are unset and runs
# the real gate per trial — so it is opt-in (its own `make groundwork-shakedown`),
# not part of the fast hermetic `make shakedown` gate. Proves the gate discriminates
# a clean solution from an invariant-violating one THROUGH the whole pipeline.
make groundwork-shakedown                        # or: ARGS=--plant-funnel-fixtures
uv run python scripts/shakedown/groundwork_pipeline.py --plant-funnel-fixtures

# L2 — passing official render with a REAL Anthropic judge
uv run --env-file .env python scripts/shakedown/official.py

# L6 — real LLMs solving tasks in real hermetic containers, egress metered
#      per trial through the harness-managed metering proxy
uv run --env-file .env python scripts/shakedown/harbor.py

# L6 — multi-turn multi-agent variant: haiku vs sonnet arms, third-vendor
#      openai judge; proves the flight recorder captures agent-attributed
#      multi-turn reasoning
uv run --env-file .env python scripts/shakedown/harbor_multiagent.py

# L4 — container guarantees on real Docker (builds synthetic images)
VERDI_REQUIRE_DOCKER=1 uv run pytest -m docker -v

# L5 — operator/reviewer/author UIs in a real browser
VERDI_PLAYWRIGHT_PATH=... VERDI_CHROMIUM_PATH=... VERDI_REQUIRE_BROWSER=1 \
  uv run pytest tests/test_eval14_page_drive.py tests/test_eval19_operator_p2.py \

```

`.env` supplies `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` (see `.env.example`).
Generated run state lands in `_run/` (git-ignored); committed inputs are under
`assets/`.

Known defect (tracked; delete this note when the metering fix lands):
`harbor_multiagent.py`'s "per-trial egress attributed" check can fail
intermittently — a trial container occasionally cannot resolve the metering
proxy's container name (`EAI_AGAIN` via Docker's embedded DNS), so its workflow
dies un-metered and the check truthfully reports the trial as unattributed. A
harness metering bug, not a property of the workflow under test; see the note
in [`docs/design/shakedown.md`](../../docs/design/shakedown.md).

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `_harness.py` | script-local plumbing — `Tally`, `_run/` staging, the one `bench` console-script driver (pre-registration vectors), ANSI strip, key gating + banners; `dump_yaml` stays for tripwires' deliberately-invalid specs |
| `_scenario.py` | shared known-answer scenario content — the canonical golden experiment shape (single-sourced so L1/L2/L3 cannot drift), manifest/pipeline helpers, and the harbor-shared config/checks (the egress check reads the raw proxy log as independent evidence) |
| `golden.py` · `tripwires.py` | hermetic acceptance (L1, L3), authored + driven through `harness.sdk` |
| `groundwork_pipeline.py` | P3 local-half pilot smoke (plan §6/§10): fake-engine pipeline over corpus groundwork-v0, graded through the REAL flowmap/groundwork gate (local-exec ADVISORY tier); builds the verdi-go binaries if unset; `--plant-funnel-fixtures` also exercises `scripts/funnel_metrics.py` on planted synthetic MCP fixtures |
| `official.py` | opt-in real-judge layer (L2), on `harness.sdk` |
| `harbor.py` · `harbor_multiagent.py` | opt-in real-container layers (L6), on `harness.sdk` + `harness.images` (the official `generic-llm` / reference multi-agent images) + the managed metering proxy |
| `assets/golden/` | the committed golden vectors (still pinned by a schema test) |
