"""Shared CLI plumbing for the stage verbs [refactor 02 §3].

Each stage CLI is a thin shell over its subsystem ``api`` module: it parses
arguments, resolves the ledgered actor, maps typed refusals to an exit code, and
echoes. This module owns the two idioms every verb repeated — the
refusal→``typer.Exit`` ceremony and actor→``EventContext`` resolution [GR-12] —
so a stage CLI adds a verb without re-deriving either. ``refusal_exit()`` with no
arguments catches the shared :class:`~harness.errors.VerdiRefusal` base
uniformly, so a refusal type a verb forgot to enumerate is still a clean named
exit 2 rather than a raw traceback [refactor 13 OI-B]. A verb that maps DIFFERENT
refusals to DIFFERENT exit codes or messages keeps an explicit narrow
enumeration: it catches exactly the named types and lets everything else
propagate to its sibling handler (the grade code-1/code-2 ladder, run's
NoTasksError→BadParameter, anchor's CHAIN BROKEN).
